<h2>What is a Public Adjuster?</h2>
<p>
According to Policyholders of America, an insurance advocacy organization, "A Public Adjuster is educated and trained in policy issues on property damage claims. Public Adjusters work exclusively to enhance the benefits of a policyholder."</p>

<h3>Public Adjusters are licensed professionals that do the following for their clients:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li>Assessment of your loss</li>
<li>Thorough analysis of your policy</li>
<li>Prepare your claim</li>
<li>Present your claim to the insurance company adjuster</li>
<li>Consult with you - you are the boss!</li>
<li>Negotiate a prompt settlement</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A wise man once said this about insurance company adjusters: "There is an inherent conflict of interest when one person or entity attempts to represent two sides of a financial transaction."
